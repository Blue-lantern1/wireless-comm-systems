– Implemented multi-antenna Rayleigh fading system with number of antennas = 2,3; generated BER vs SNR curves for
QPSK detection to achieve at least a BER = 0.0000001.
– Simulated OFDM wireless sytem with 64 subcarriers, 3 channel taps; generated BER vs SNR curves for QPSK symbols
to achieve at least a BER = 0.00001.
– Simulated 2x2 MIMO wireless sytem with BPSK symbols using ZF receiver; genrated BER vs SNR curves.
